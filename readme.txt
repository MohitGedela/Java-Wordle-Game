How to play:
Type in five letter guesses until you have found the correct word. You have six guesses. Hints will be given in the following format:

🟩 = Correct letter in the correct spot.
🟨 = That letter is in the word but in a different spot.
⬜ = That letter is not in the word.

There will be a 6 square line that shows the results for that guess + the alphabet with the best result you have found for each letter next to it.

Example: (Correct word is mafia)

a🟨 b❔ c⬜ d❔ e⬜ f❔ g❔ h❔ i❔ j❔ k❔ l❔ m❔ n❔ o❔ p⬜ q❔ r❔ s⬜ t❔ u❔ v❔ w❔ x❔ y❔ z❔

After playing you can input 1 to play again with a new word or 2 to exit.

If you input something that isn't a five letter word, you will be prompted to input something else.

If the top of the console appears to be a mess of _, / () \ etc., that's because your onsole is too small and the ascii art logo does not have enough room to be seen correcty. This is not a required part of the game to see.
